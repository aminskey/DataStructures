# The Stack data structure

## What is a stack??
The Stack data structure is a concept based on stacks of items.  
Like a stack of papers. The concept is also known as **L.I.F.O.**  
_Basically Last in first out_

As you can see, we have a stack of papers right in front of us.  

	-----
	-----
	-----
	-----
	~~~~~  ----> the first paper to enter the stack

The first one to enter the stack will be the last one to exit.  

## Why use a stack??

Now that's a good question.  
Let's suppose you want to reverse something you'd store the opposite in a second container  
And then you'd have your result  
  
  
Or Maybe you want to prioritise things, or want to stack bricks on top of each other.  
Programs like **Towers of Hanoi, and others that i haven't heard of** use this concept  

## What kind of stacks are there??

### Well you have

1. Hay stacks 
2. Paper stacks
3. Plate stacks
_etc._  
**Just kidding**

### These are the types of stacks there are (OR THOSE THAT I KNOW OF)

1. Linkedlist stacks
2. Array Stacks

## Are There any Pros and Cons??
Yup  

**Arrays:**
	
	Arrays don't take up memory space, as compared to Linked lists.
	But the major issue is that it has limited space.

**Linked List:**

	As Compared to arrays. The linked list is dynamic but takes up a lot of memory space
