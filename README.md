# Data Structures
I have decided to increase my programming knowledge    
by diving deep into some of the basics of programming.    
Like my father always said:     
    
_**"To be a good programmer.    
You must ace data structures and algorithms"**_    
    
That was like months ago, even this repo's pretty old.    
But I have decided to start from start.    
I created some libraries, that make it easy for me    
and will hopefully make it easy for the programmers working with data structures
